## Features

### Welcome screen

The first time you open the app, you'll be presented with this screen.

We ask for your name, email and phone number so that we can sign you up to volunteer. You'll need to provide all of these in order to use the app.

If you've already entered your information on a device, but have logged out, you can click the link below the "Submit" button to log back in. To log back in, you only need to provide your email address.

**Note: Your information is not synced between devices, so you won't be able to log in to a device you haven't previously provided information on.**

### Navigation tabs

You can navigate the different screens of the FoodForThought app using the tabs at the bottom of the screen. The different screen and their functions are listed below.

#### "Your Shifts" Tab

If you've already signed up for a shift, it will show up here. Clicking on a shift will show details about the shift, including the time, location, job description, and any additional notes FoodForThought has decided to include, such as weather information. You can get directions to the shift's location by pressing the "Directions" button, and check in when you get there by pressing the "Check In" button.

#### Signing up to volunteer

You can press the "Sign Up to Volunteer" button to sign up for a shift. When you do, you'll see a calendar view where you can select what day you'd like to sign up for.

### Settings screen

The settings screen allows you to switch users and enable auto-check in. Enabling auto check in allows you to check in automatically when you're near the volunteer location.

## Admin features

The admin tab takes the place of the contact screen when an Admin is using the FoodForThought app. From here, you can check volunteers in, create new notifications, and manage shift times and locations.
